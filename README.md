# hello-world

Howdy. My name is Stephen. I got my BA in Psychology in 2018 and haven't really done much with it. I recently have become quite interested in computer science. In the past I was a little deterred from pursuing comp. sci. due to the difficulty but I am now confident and fully determined to learn programming (and perhaps some data science) in order to do more with a larger skillset.
